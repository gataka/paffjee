Philipps awesome framework for JEE

## Overview

This is a set off cool stuff from the rest off the world (Spring, Netflix, etc.) transformed for JEE7.


This is just a hobby stuff not perfect but hopefully helpful.

Be free to add more useful stuff. The only goal to reach is to have better code than "hello world" which is a common "google result" for JEE problems and solutions.
I want to solve real problems from the "enterprise" for the "enterprise".
