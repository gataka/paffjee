Philipps awesome framework for JEE

## Overview

This is a set off cool stuff from the rest off the world (Spring, Netflix, etc.) transformed for JEE7.


This is just a hobby stuff not perfect but hopefully helpful.

Be free to add more useful stuff. The only goal to reach is to have better code than "hello world" which is a common "google result" for JEE problems and solutions.
I want to solve real problems from the "enterprise" for the "enterprise".

## Features

Here is a list of featers which are available, planned or under work.

### Planned

* Oauth/JWT JACC/JASS Providers to map Oauth-Scopes to Groups and support "oauth-login"
* Jersey Plugin to forward Oauth-Tokens
* Jersey Plugin to forward correlationIds
* Service-Regitry support (e.g. Eureka or others) 
* Jersey-Plugin to support "Ribbon" style servicediscovery and loadbalancing
* Dynamic Default endpoint support like Spring actuator
* Autodetecting Api for Metric and health
* Autodocumented Application (like Spring REST-DOC) with Swagger and asciidoc
* JPA-REST-API (Like Spring REST-Repository) for  JPA-Enities (This will be a big and heavy thing but solves many "default problems")

### Under construction

* Configuration Injection like "Spring configuration" with commons-configuration2 (open is a version with Netflix archaius)
* Demo-Application to see how it can be used.
* Circuite-Breaker Integration with Hystrix

### Finished
Currently nothing. There is a lot of work to do.
